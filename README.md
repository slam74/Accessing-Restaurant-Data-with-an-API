# Accessing Restaurant Data with an API

Works with an API on the client-side to produce a user interface for accessing data. Created using CSS/JS code and libraries including Lodash, Moment.js, Leaflet, jQuery and Bootstrap.

The user interface is a single table that shows a subset of the restaurant data (ie. Name, Cuisine, Address, Average Score). When the user clicks on a specific restaurant (row) in the table, they will be shown a modal window that shows an interactive map indicating where the restaurant is located.
